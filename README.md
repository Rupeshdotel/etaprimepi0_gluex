# etaprimepi0_gluex

The project is about Analysis of etaprimepi0 in gluex in search of exotic hybrid meson pi1(1600), previously studied by COMPASS and VES. Ultimate goal is to do partial wave analysis of etaprimepi0 invariant mass. Project basically uses C++ and python. DSelectors (developed on top of TSelectors in root) are used to do coarse event selection (missing mass squared, timing cut and coherent energy region). Detail event selection is done using event_sel.py. Choice of values are read through separate ASCII file (parameters.data). After selection, make_event_counts_unique.py can be used to reject repeated events, to avoid multiple counting of events. qfac_analysis.py is used to signal-background separation for etaprimepi0 system. qfac_analysis.py  uses class_fit.py that defines Bernstein polynomials for background modeling. Parameter estimation are done using least-square fitting as well as likelihood fitting. To study Monte-Carlo, kintree_to_genkin.py takes kin tree as input. kin tree has branches with  arrays for momentum and energy for final states and beam. Output of kintree_to_genkin.py  is a npz file that has required kinematics to study generated events. Getting to required generated kinematics from kintree is done alternatively (preferred method, 25 times faster than python) using Sel_gen_events.C.
